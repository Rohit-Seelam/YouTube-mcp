‚è∫ Perfect! Great news that it's working now. Let me explain the high-level approach of the fixed caption extraction function (lines
  25-115):

  High-Level Flow

  üéØ The Problem We Solved

  - Before: We tried to manually download subtitle URLs ‚Üí Got JSON metadata instead of text
  - After: We let yt-dlp handle the entire subtitle processing ‚Üí Get clean text files

  üîÑ The New Approach (File-Based)

  1. Setup Temp Environment (lines 31-43)
  with tempfile.TemporaryDirectory() as temp_dir:
      # Create isolated workspace for yt-dlp to write files

  2. Two-Phase Process:

  Phase 1: Discovery (lines 46-70)
  - Use extract_info(download=False) to explore what's available
  - Get list of all subtitle languages (manual + automatic)
  - Choose the best language match

  Phase 2: Download (lines 72-79)
  - Configure yt-dlp with the specific language
  - Use ydl.download() to actually write subtitle files to temp directory
  - Let yt-dlp handle all the URL fetching and format conversion

  3. File Reading (lines 81-91)
  - Use glob.glob() to find the generated .srt file
  - Read the file directly from disk
  - Apply our text cleaning function

  üîß Key Technical Changes

  | Aspect      | Old (Broken)             | New (Working)             |
  |-------------|--------------------------|---------------------------|
  | Method      | Manual URL download      | File-based via yt-dlp     |
  | Data Source | Raw YouTube API response | Processed subtitle files  |
  | Format      | JSON metadata            | Clean SRT text            |
  | Processing  | Manual parsing           | yt-dlp handles everything |

  üí° Why This Works

  1. yt-dlp knows how to process subtitle URLs - It handles all the YouTube API intricacies
  2. File-based approach is reliable - We get the final processed result, not intermediate data
  3. Temporary directory is clean - No file system pollution, auto-cleanup
  4. Language fallback is robust - Handles country codes and variations

  The key insight was: Stop fighting yt-dlp, let it do what it does best! Instead of trying to reverse-engineer its internal subtitle
  processing, we use its built-in file writing capabilities and read the results.

‚è∫ Perfect! Let me explain each detail with concrete examples.

  1. with tempfile.TemporaryDirectory() as temp_dir:

  What it does:
  # Creates a temporary folder like: /tmp/tmp_abc123xyz/
  # Assigns the path to temp_dir variable
  # When the 'with' block exits, AUTOMATICALLY deletes the entire folder

  Example:
  import tempfile
  import os

  with tempfile.TemporaryDirectory() as temp_dir:
      print(f"Temp folder created: {temp_dir}")
      # temp_dir might be: "/tmp/tmp_k8j2n9x1/"

      # Create a file inside
      test_file = os.path.join(temp_dir, "test.txt")
      with open(test_file, 'w') as f:
          f.write("Hello")

      print(f"File exists: {os.path.exists(test_file)}")  # True

  # When we exit the 'with' block, the folder and ALL files inside are deleted
  print(f"Folder exists: {os.path.exists(temp_dir)}")  # False

  2. Exact Location of Downloaded Subtitles

  Line 41: 'outtmpl': os.path.join(temp_dir, '%(title)s.%(ext)s')

  Example:
  - temp_dir = /tmp/tmp_abc123/
  - Video title = "How I'd Learn AI in 2025"
  - Language = "en"
  - Final file path: /tmp/tmp_abc123/How I'd Learn AI in 2025.en.srt

  The path construction:
  # temp_dir = "/tmp/tmp_abc123/"
  # os.path.join(temp_dir, '%(title)s.%(ext)s') becomes:
  # "/tmp/tmp_abc123/%(title)s.%(ext)s"

  # yt-dlp replaces:
  # %(title)s ‚Üí "How I'd Learn AI in 2025"
  # %(ext)s ‚Üí "en.srt"
  # Final: "/tmp/tmp_abc123/How I'd Learn AI in 2025.en.srt"

  3. Language Selection Logic (lines 64-70)

  target_lang = language_preference or 'en'  # User wants "en"
  all_captions = {
      'en': [...],           # English
      'en-US': [...],        # English (US)
      'es': [...],           # Spanish
      'fr': [...]            # French
  }

  # Step 1: Exact match
  if target_lang in all_captions:          # if "en" in dict
      chosen_lang = target_lang            # chosen_lang = "en" ‚úì

  # Step 2: Partial match (if exact fails)
  elif any(lang.startswith(target_lang) for lang in all_captions):
      # Checks: does "en-US".startswith("en")? ‚Üí True
      chosen_lang = next(lang for lang in all_captions if lang.startswith(target_lang))
      # chosen_lang = "en-US"

  # Step 3: Fallback (if nothing matches)
  else:
      chosen_lang = list(all_captions.keys())[0]  # First available language
      # chosen_lang = "en" (whatever comes first)

  Real example:
  # User wants "en", available: ["en-GB", "es", "fr"]
  target_lang = "en"

  # Step 1: "en" in ["en-GB", "es", "fr"]? ‚Üí False
  # Step 2: Does any start with "en"? "en-GB".startswith("en") ‚Üí True
  # Result: chosen_lang = "en-GB"

  4. with yt_dlp.YoutubeDL(ydl_opts) as ydl:

  What it does:
  # Similar to file opening, but for yt-dlp objects
  # Creates a yt-dlp downloader instance
  # Automatically cleans up resources when done

  Equivalent without 'with':
  # Without 'with' (manual cleanup)
  ydl = yt_dlp.YoutubeDL(ydl_opts)
  try:
      info = ydl.extract_info(url, download=False)
  finally:
      ydl.close()  # Manual cleanup

  # With 'with' (automatic cleanup)
  with yt_dlp.YoutubeDL(ydl_opts) as ydl:
      info = ydl.extract_info(url, download=False)
      # Automatically calls ydl.close() when exiting

  5. Automatic File Deletion (No Manual Code Needed!)

  The magic is in the with tempfile.TemporaryDirectory():

  def get_video_captions(self, ...):
      with tempfile.TemporaryDirectory() as temp_dir:  # Creates temp folder
          # ... download subtitles to temp_dir ...

          # Read the subtitle file
          with open(subtitle_files[0], 'r') as f:
              caption_text = f.read()

          return {
              'captions': caption_text,
              # ...
          }
      # ‚Üê HERE: Python automatically deletes temp_dir and ALL files inside

      # No manual deletion needed!

  Timeline:
  1. Function starts ‚Üí Temp folder created: /tmp/tmp_abc123/
  2. yt-dlp downloads ‚Üí File created: /tmp/tmp_abc123/video.en.srt
  3. We read the file ‚Üí Caption text extracted
  4. Function ends ‚Üí Python automatically deletes /tmp/tmp_abc123/ and everything inside

  6. lang_base = chosen_lang.split('-')[0]

  Purpose: Handle language codes with country variants

  Examples:
  # Example 1: Full language code
  chosen_lang = "en-US"
  lang_base = chosen_lang.split('-')[0]  # "en"

  # Example 2: Simple language code  
  chosen_lang = "fr"
  lang_base = chosen_lang.split('-')[0]  # "fr"

  # Example 3: Multiple parts
  chosen_lang = "zh-Hans-CN"
  lang_base = chosen_lang.split('-')[0]  # "zh"

  Why we need this (lines 82-86):
  # First try: Look for exact language file
  subtitle_files = glob.glob(os.path.join(temp_dir, f'*.{chosen_lang}.srt'))
  # Looking for: "video.en-US.srt"

  if not subtitle_files:
      # Maybe yt-dlp saved it as just "en" instead of "en-US"
      lang_base = chosen_lang.split('-')[0]  # "en-US" ‚Üí "en"
      subtitle_files = glob.glob(os.path.join(temp_dir, f'*.{lang_base}.srt'))
      # Now looking for: "video.en.srt"

  Real scenario:
  - User requests: language_preference = "en-US"
  - yt-dlp might save file as: video.en.srt (without country code)
  - First search fails: *.en-US.srt ‚Üí Nothing found
  - Fallback search succeeds: *.en.srt ‚Üí File found!

  This makes our code robust to yt-dlp's file naming variations.


  2.

  In Python, `**` in a dict literal is the ‚Äúdictionary unpacking‚Äù operator.  

So when you write:

```python
all_captions = { **subtitles, **automatic_captions }
```

what happens is:

1. Python takes every key-value pair from `subtitles` and inserts them into a new dict.
2. Then it takes every key-value pair from `automatic_captions` and inserts them as well.
3. If the same key exists in both, the value from `automatic_captions` will overwrite the one from `subtitles`.

Under the hood it‚Äôs roughly equivalent to:

```python
all_captions = subtitles.copy()
all_captions.update(automatic_captions)
```

But the `{ **a, **b }` syntax is a more concise way to merge two (or more) dictionaries into a brand-new dict.

  Recommendations:

  1. Create a PROJECT_LOG.md file (Recommended approach)

  This would serve both purposes you mentioned:
  - For future Claude sessions: Clear project understanding without over-expanding CLAUDE.md
  - For your reference: Detailed record of what was accomplished and learned

  2. About the #memorize command

  The #memorize command stores information in Claude's session memory, but it's session-specific and won't persist across
  different conversations. It's useful for current conversation context but not for long-term project documentation.

  3. CLAUDE.md vs PROJECT_LOG.md strategy

  - CLAUDE.md: Keep focused on current project state, architecture, and immediate instructions
  - PROJECT_LOG.md: Detailed progress, learnings, issues resolved, and implementation notes

  4. Token considerations

  - CLAUDE.md is read frequently, so keep it concise
  - PROJECT_LOG.md would only be referenced when needed (via @ mention)
  - Using @ to reference specific sections is efficient

  Proposed Structure for PROJECT_LOG.md:

  # YouTube MCP Project Log

  ## Project Overview
  Brief description and current status

  ## Phase Completion Log
  ### Phase 0: Project Documentation (Completed)
  ### Phase 1: Basic Setup (Completed)
  ### Phase 2: MCP Server Implementation (Completed)
  - Key achievements
  - Issues encountered and solutions
  - Technical decisions made

  ## Technical Learnings
  ## Architecture Decisions
  ## Known Issues & Limitations
  ## Next Steps


  ----


  ‚è∫ Perfect! ‚úÖ PROJECT_LOG.md has been created successfully

  What this accomplishes:

  üéØ For Future Claude Sessions:

  - Complete project context without overwhelming CLAUDE.md
  - Technical decisions and rationale documented
  - Issue resolution patterns for similar problems
  - Architecture understanding for informed development

  üìã For Your Reference:

  - Detailed progress tracking through all phases
  - Critical issues and solutions - you can see exactly what problems we solved and how
  - Technical learnings captured for future projects
  - Development metrics and timeline tracking

  üí° Key Benefits:

  1. Token Efficiency: CLAUDE.md stays focused, PROJECT_LOG.md referenced only when needed
  2. Historical Record: Complete development journey documented
  3. Knowledge Transfer: Easy for new developers (or future Claude sessions) to understand
  4. Decision Context: Why we made specific technical choices

  üîÑ Usage Pattern:

  - Reference with @: @PROJECT_LOG.md when you need detailed context
  - Update after phases: Add new sections as project progresses
  - Search friendly: Well-structured for finding specific information

  This file now serves as your comprehensive project knowledge base while keeping CLAUDE.md lean and focused on current
  development needs. Ready for Phase 3! üöÄ
