> cool that's great, Now i want to improvise our project by adding a new markddown file.\
  \There are two main puprposes of this file: one is for the next claude agents/claude conversations i run (similar to this) 
  to have a clear undersadning on the project than just relyting on high-level stuff available. The second purpose is for me 
  to understand what we did so far in detail. This detail need not involve extensive debugging or error fixing but maybe 
  something on a high level like for example: we faced X issue we resolved it using Y mcp.
   I know that we do have claude.md for that purpose but i feel i will be over expanding it if i add too much info. I am 
  saying this because i don't know how many times claude.md will be called internally. I feel now that it is only called at 
  the beginning of the conversation and later whenver it feels like it needs to.  \
  \I want to get best recommendations from you for this. Right now my thinking is to use something below context, please 
  understand that my thinking might be trivial and in-efficent, so correct me if i am wrong regarding the best practices.\
  1. use the #memorize command suggested by claude i saw earlier. However i don't know exactly what this does.\
  2. To use /compact or just after every long conversation generate text for the two puprposes i said earlier and put it 
  separately in some file like progress.md and reference it myself when neceessary and also refere it with @ inside claude.md
   but still i am not sure if i will burn too many tokens if i do the latter.

  Recommendations:

  1. Create a PROJECT_LOG.md file (Recommended approach)

  This would serve both purposes you mentioned:
  - For future Claude sessions: Clear project understanding without over-expanding CLAUDE.md
  - For your reference: Detailed record of what was accomplished and learned

  2. About the #memorize command

  The #memorize command stores information in Claude's session memory, but it's session-specific and won't persist across
  different conversations. It's useful for current conversation context but not for long-term project documentation.

  3. CLAUDE.md vs PROJECT_LOG.md strategy

  - CLAUDE.md: Keep focused on current project state, architecture, and immediate instructions
  - PROJECT_LOG.md: Detailed progress, learnings, issues resolved, and implementation notes

  4. Token considerations

  - CLAUDE.md is read frequently, so keep it concise
  - PROJECT_LOG.md would only be referenced when needed (via @ mention)
  - Using @ to reference specific sections is efficient

  Proposed Structure for PROJECT_LOG.md:

  # YouTube MCP Project Log

  ## Project Overview
  Brief description and current status

  ## Phase Completion Log
  ### Phase 0: Project Documentation (Completed)
  ### Phase 1: Basic Setup (Completed)
  ### Phase 2: MCP Server Implementation (Completed)
  - Key achievements
  - Issues encountered and solutions
  - Technical decisions made

  ## Technical Learnings
  ## Architecture Decisions
  ## Known Issues & Limitations
  ## Next Steps

  ‚è∫ What ‚úÖ PROJECT_LOG.md accomplishes:

  üéØ For Future Claude Sessions:

  - Complete project context without overwhelming CLAUDE.md
  - Technical decisions and rationale documented
  - Issue resolution patterns for similar problems
  - Architecture understanding for informed development

  üìã For Your Reference:

  - Detailed progress tracking through all phases
  - Critical issues and solutions - you can see exactly what problems we solved and how
  - Technical learnings captured for future projects
  - Development metrics and timeline tracking

  üí° Key Benefits:

  1. Token Efficiency: CLAUDE.md stays focused, PROJECT_LOG.md referenced only when needed
  2. Historical Record: Complete development journey documented
  3. Knowledge Transfer: Easy for new developers (or future Claude sessions) to understand
  4. Decision Context: Why we made specific technical choices

  üîÑ Usage Pattern:

  - Reference with @: @PROJECT_LOG.md when you need detailed context
  - Update after phases: Add new sections as project progresses
  - Search friendly: Well-structured for finding specific information

  This file now serves as your comprehensive project knowledge base while keeping CLAUDE.md lean and focused on current
  development needs. Ready for Phase 3! üöÄ
